The Stock Portfolio Management project is a Python application designed to help users keep track of their stock investments. With this app, you can easily add, remove, and view stocks in your portfolio while monitoring how your investments are performing over time. It allows you to enter details like the stock symbol, quantity, purchase price, and purchase date, providing a straightforward way to manage your financial assets.

The application features a summary view that shows your total investment, current value, and overall performance of your stocks. It automatically fetches current stock prices, enabling you to see your gains or losses in real time. Additionally, you can export your portfolio data to a CSV file for easy sharing and reporting, making it a versatile tool for both novice and experienced investors.

Once set up, you can run the application and follow the on-screen instructions to manage your stock portfolio. This project aims to simplify the process of tracking and managing your investments effectively.
